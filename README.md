# archiever
Archiever without compression
if you want to compress a directory/file, you ought to use command pack <Name of your directory/file>.
if you want to decompress a directory/file, you ought to use command unpack <Name of the directory, where the compressed directory/file will be decompressed>
Soon will be added arguements to commands that will let to choose the place where the compressed directory/file will be put in the first case and
in the second case to choose the compress directory/file to unpack.
